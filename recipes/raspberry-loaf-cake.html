            <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>1 1/2 teaspons baking powder</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Coulis:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>5 ounces fresh raspberries</li>
            <li>3/8 confectioners' sugar</li>
            <li>3 drops lemon juice</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). 
                Grease an 8x4-inch loaf tin with soft margarine and set aside.
            <li>
            
            <li>Cream superfine sugar and butter together with a paddle attachment of a free-standing electric 
                mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy.
            </li>
            
            <li>Whisk eggs and vanilla extract together in a separate bowl until just mixed; do not over-whisk. 
                Beat gradually into the butter mixture until well incorporated. 
                Sift in flour and baking powder, bit by bit, folding after each addition. Set batter aside.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Puree raspberries, confectioners' sugar, and lemon juice in a food processor until smooth. 
                Strain through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl. 
                Separate half of the cake mix into a different bowl and stir the coulis through.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Put alternating dollops of the raspberry and vanilla batters into the prepared loaf tin using a small 
                ice cream scoop. 
                Swirl both sets of dollops together slightly using the blunt end of a skewer.
            </li>

            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until the top of the cake is golden brown and risen and a toothpick inserted into 
                the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let cool in the tin for 5 to 10 minutes. 
                Run a table knife around the edges of the tin and remove the cake, leaving to cool completely on a wire rack.
            </li>
        </ol>
