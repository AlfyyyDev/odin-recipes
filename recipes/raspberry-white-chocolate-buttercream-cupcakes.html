        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
            </li>
            
            <li>Grease 24 muffin cups or line with paper liners.
            </li>
            
            <li>Mix together vanilla cake mix, 1 cup water, vegetable oil, and eggs in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer on 
                low speed until cake mix is moist. Raise mixer speed to medium and beat until batter is smooth, 2 minutes.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Spoon batter into prepared muffin cups, filling them about 2/3 full.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cupcakes are very lightly browned and a toothpick inserted into the center 
                of a cupcake comes out clean, 18 to 23 minutes.
            </li>

            <li>
                Cool cupcakes in the pans for 5 minutes; transfer cupcakes to cooling rack to finish cooling.
            </li>
            
            <li>
                Place raspberries, 1 tablespoon water, and white sugar in a blender and pulse several times to chop raspberries; 
                blend until pureed, about 30 seconds.
            </li>
            
            <li>Whisk cornstarch with 1/4 cup water until thoroughly combined; pour into the raspberry mixture in the blender and 
                blend again until smooth.
            </li>
            
            <li>Pour raspberry mixture into a saucepan and simmer over low heat until thickened, about 5 minutes. Let the raspberry 
                filling cool.
            </li>

            <li>Cut a core out of each cupcake about 1 1/2 inches long and 1 inch in diameter.
            </li>

            <li>Spoon about 2 teaspoons raspberry filling into each cupcake.
            </li>

            <li>Place white chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl and heat in 30-second intervals until chips begin 
                to melt, about 1 minute. Stir and repeat, heating chips about 10 seconds at a time, until thoroughly 
                melted. Stir until chocolate is smooth and no more lumps remain.
            </li>

            <li>Beat butter with an electric mixer on medium speed in a mixing bowl until fluffy. Beat in half the 
                confectioners' sugar, melted white chocolate chips, and milk until mixture is smooth and creamy.
            </li>

            <li>Slowly beat in remaining confectioners' sugar until smooth; if frosting is too stiff, beat in more milk,
                 1 teaspoon at a time.
            </li>

            <li>Spread or pipe the white chocolate frosting over the cupcakes to cover the raspberry filling; drizzle or 
                pipe any remaining raspberry filling over the cupcakes.
            </li>

        </ol>
